'I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo. 'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.'~Tolkien
Contemplating the depths of Godâ€™s judgments, the same Antony inquired: 'Lord, how is it that some die after a short life while others grow very old? Why are some in penury and others affluent? How do the wicked become affluent while the righteous are impoverished? 'A voice came to him that said: 'Antony, pay attention to yourself, for these are the judgments of God and it is not to your advantage for you to learn about them.'~Antony 2 
Abba Antony said to Abba Poemen: 'This is the great task of a person: personally to take responsibility for his own shortcoming in the presence of God and to expect temptation until his last breath.'~Antony 4 
Abba Pambo asked Abba Antony: 'What am I to do?' The elder said to him: 'Have no confidence in your righteousness; have no regrets about a past action; get control of your tongue and your belly.'~Antony 6 
The same [elder] said: 'Always have the fear of God before your eyes. Remember him who gives death and life [1 Sam 2.6]. Hate the world and all that is in it. Hate all physical repose. Renounce this life so you may live for God. Remember what you promised to God, for he will be looking for it from you on the Day of Judgment. Be hungry and thirsty, endure nakedness, keep watch; sorrow, weep, and groan in your hearts. Examine whether you are worthy of God. Despise the flesh in order to save your souls.'~Antony 33  
The demons once set upon Abba Arsenius in his cell and were afflicting him. When those who were looking after him came by and were standing outside his cell, they heard him crying out to God, saying: 'O God, do not abandon me! I have done no good thing in your sight but, of your kindness, grant me to make a start.'~Arsenius 3  
A brother asked Abba Arsenius if he could hear a saying from him. The elder said to him: 'As much as you are able, strive so that what goes on inside you be godly and you conquer your external passions.'~Arsenius 9  
He also said: 'If we seek for God, he will appear to us and, if we hold him fast, he will remain with us.'~Arsenius 10
